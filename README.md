![airplanecrash](https://github.com/Divinegrace05/aircraft_risk_data_analysis/assets/134943380/85025fc4-43d7-424d-b0e5-2bcdc61d9321)


Overview
This project focuses on analyzing aviation accident data to provide actionable insights for a company's new aviation division. The analysis aims to identify aircraft models with the lowest risk profiles to guide the company in selecting safe aircraft for commercial and private ventures.

Business Understanding
Stakeholder: Head of the new aviation division
Key Business Questions:

Which aircraft models offer the lowest risk profile for purchase and operation?
What are the trends in aviation accidents over the years?
What extent of injuries and damage types are caused by aviation accidents?
Which aircraft types are most commonly involved in accidents with minor damages and uninjured persons?
What are the top aircraft makes and models for specific flight purposes?
Is there any correlation between different variables in aviation accidents?
Data Understanding and Analysis
Source of Data
The dataset is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, containing aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023.

Description of Data
The dataset includes various details about aviation accidents, such as aircraft type, injury severity, damage type, flight purpose, and location.

## Conclusion:
The analysis reveals several key insights:

1. A declining trend in aviation accidents over the years suggests improvements in safety practices.
2. Aircraft accidents often result in fatal injuries and substantial damage.
3. Airplanes and helicopters are the most common types involved in accidents with highest count of uninjured persons.
4. Aircrafts with fewer engines tend to have higher involvement in high risk accidents.
5. There is no strong correlation observed between different variables in aviation accidents.


## Recommendation:
Based on the analysis findings, it is recommended that the company prioritize aircraft types, makes, and models with proven safety records and minimal involvement in accidents resulting in minor damages and uninjured persons. Specifically:

Aircraft Type:
1. Airplane: Considering the prevalence of airplane accidents with uninjured persons, models such as the Boeing 737 exhibit relatively lower risks.
2. Helicopter: Despite their utility, helicopters are also commonly involved in accidents, suggesting the need for careful evaluation before selection.

Flight Purposes (Top Models):
1. Personal: Aircraft models such as the Cessna 210L are recommended for personal use due to their relatively lower involvement in accidents resulting in minor damages and uninjured persons.
2. Business: For commercial ventures, aircraft models like the Cessna S550 are preferred, given their safety records.
3. Ferry: CESSNA PA-31-310
4. Executive/corporate: Airplane, PIPER PA-31-350
5. Instructional: Airplane, PIPER PA-44-180
6. Public Aircraft: BEECH BE-200
7. Positioning: CESSNA 402C
8. Other Work Use: CESSNA MU2B
9. Aerial Observation/Application: AIR TRACTOR AT-401
10. Flight Test: PIPER PA-28-236

Overall, the selection of aircraft should prioritize safety performance while ensuring alignment with operational needs. Thorough safety evaluations and ongoing monitoring of safety metrics are essential to mitigate risks and ensure the success and safety of aviation operations.
