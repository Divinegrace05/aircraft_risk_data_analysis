# aircraft_risk_data_analysis

# Overview
This repository contains the analysis of aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, aimed at providing actionable insights for a company's new aviation division. The analysis focuses on identifying aircraft models with the lowest risk profile, guiding the company's strategic expansion into the aviation sector.

# Business Understanding
The stakeholder, head of the new aviation division, seeks answers to key questions:
1. Which aircraft types pose the lowest risk for purchase and operation?
2. What is the safety performance of different aircraft models?
3. How can we differentiate between aircraft suitable for commercial ventures and those more suitable for private use?

# Data Understanding and Analysis
## Source of Data
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, comprising civil aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023, including various attributes such as aircraft type, injury severity, and accident location.

## Description of Data
The dataset consists of 88,889 entries with 31 columns, primarily categorical, and containing missing values. Key tasks included data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization.

### Three Visualizations
1. Trend of Aviation Accidents Over the Years

   This line plot illustrates a decline in the number of aviation accidents over the years, indicating improvements in aviation safety.

2. Distribution of Injury Severity and Damage Type
   ![Injury and Damage Distribution](images/injury_damage_distribution.png)
   These two bar plots depict the distribution of injury severity and damage types resulting from aviation accidents, providing insights into the extent of injuries and damages caused.

3. Types of Aircrafts Involved in Accidents with Uninjured Persons
   ![Aircraft Types Distribution](images/aircraft_types_distribution.png)
   This plot showcases the distribution of different aircraft types involved in accidents with uninjured persons, aiding in the identification of aircraft types with lower risk profiles.

# Conclusion
The analysis prioritizes aircraft models with a track record of low accident rates, minimal injuries, and minor damages for both commercial and private enterprises. 'Airplane' and 'Helicopter' are identified as commonly involved aircraft types with lower risk profiles. Recommendations emphasize selecting aircraft models aligned with operational requirements and safety performance.

## Summary of Conclusions
1. The number of aviation accidents has shown a declining trend over the years, indicating improvements in aviation safety.
2. 'Airplane' and 'Helicopter' are the most common aircraft types involved in accidents with uninjured persons, suggesting lower risk profiles.
3. Prioritizing aircraft models with proven safety records and minimal involvement in accidents is crucial for both commercial and private ventures.
